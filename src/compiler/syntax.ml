(** CamlM AST structure.
   
    A CamlM source is parsed into an {!expression} by the CamlM parser
    ({!Parser}). Base expressions include : 
   
     - A construct similiar to OCaml's option type ([Some a], [None]).
     - Ordered pairs of elements (a 2-tuple).
     - Lists.
     - Axiom declaration ([declare axiom]).
     - ...
   
    While most of these constructs can be easily understood by the average OCaml
    user, the [declare] syntax ({{!expression}[EDeclare]}) deserves some
    explanation. See the CamlM wiki (linked below).

(** Type for holding an environment. This type is parametrized - it is used in
    both {!Eval} and {!Typing}. The structure stays the same, but the payload
    differs based on the use.
   
    In the {!Eval} module, a {!fun_env_content} is held by the {!env} structure.
    In the {!Typing} module, it is a {!Typing.type_env_content}.
   
    The fields are as follow : 
     - {{!env}[this]} : name of the "current module". In the REPL, it will be
       "_toplevel". When evaluating module "Foo", it will be "Foo".
     - {{!env}[modules]} : directed graph of all opened modules. If a module B
       is exposed to a module A, there is an edge in between A and B.
     - {{!env}[namespace]} : associates names to a list of modules they occur
       in. Depending on the module, the payload (the "value" associated to the
       name in the current context) will be different.
  *)

(** Environment payload for expression evaluation (see {!Eval}). Holds the value
    of a name (None if the name is an axiom) and a list of properties (see
    {!prop}) if the name is an operator.

and fun_env_content = (expression option) * ((prop list) option)

(** Properties of an operator : {{!prop}[Com]} if operator is commutative,
    {{!prop}[Assoc]} if operator is associative.
  
    This is useful to shorten redundant patterns (e.g. no need to test for 
    patterns [(-a) + b] and [b + (-a)] as [(+)] is commutative).

(** Pattern matching structure. Represents a pattern in any pattern matching
    construct ([function ...], [match ... with], etc).
   
    It is possible to match against specific axioms using the "@" symbol (parsed
    into a {{!pattern}[PAxiom]}), or to disassemble functions around an
    operator. Again, see wiki.
